# Gressier_2022
Github repository for the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq analyses of Gressier et al. 2022 by Jonas Schulte-Schrepping

In this repository, you can find all the code that has been written by Jonas Schulte-Schrepping to analyze and visualize the scRNA-seq data presented in Gressier et al. 2022:

_CD4+ T cells select unique P65, IRF1 and FOS dependent responses in APC for integration into antiviral CD8+ T cell immunity_

For this project, single-cell transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles from monocytes and myeloid DC derived from scRNA-seq data originally published in Schulte-Schrepping et al., Cell 2020 and in Wilk et al., 2021 JEM, have been re-analyzed to investigate how T cell help regulates the way antigen-presenting cells (APC) integrate IFN-α/-β signals into effective CD8+ T cell immunity.
